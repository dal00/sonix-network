  Our core switches run the open-source NOS SONiC on self-refurbished hardware that otherwise would have become e-waste.

  Thanks to our refurbishment process we are proud to offer free 100G ports,
  optics included, at all our sites. We have other speeds too of course, but
  we are extra proud of our 100G offering.
